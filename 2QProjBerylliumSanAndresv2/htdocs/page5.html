<h1>About Fur Treasures</h1>
<p>Fur Treasures is a website dedicated to guiding all dog owners in properly taking care of their dogs. Being a dog owner is a responsibility and not an act of play, it takes a lot of dedication and hardwork in order for you and your dog to have a blissful everyday. Some people think taking care of dogs is just making sure they eat 2 times a day, giving them a bath every other day, and providing them a place to sleep, but it is a lot more than that. Owning a dog is like having a new member of the family. You should love and cherish them with all your heart.</p>

<h2>About the site owner</h2>
<p>Hello! I am a fifteen year old student, currently in ninth grade. I am a 6-year dog owner and I currently have 6 dogs: 3 girls and 3 boys. Taking care of them is really a big responsibility and it takes a lot of patience. I was only ten years old when I became a dog owner, and I had to learn a lot of things for them. I have also learned one thing: it doesn't matter how long you've been with your dog, but the knowledge of how you take care of them. You may be with your dog for 3 years, but still be not aware that they are not supposed to be fed a lot. So you can say that the saying "quality over quantity" is applicable to taking proper care of dogs.</p>

<p>I hope this website helped you in any way, whether you are an old or a new dog owner. You might feel tired at times, but the happiness they give to you is priceless. Even if you don't like or love your dog as much, always remember that they love you and they care, all dogs do! So if you are neglecting your pet right now, you might think again. Love them with all your heart and do your best to make them happy, I promise you it is worth it. Thank you for visiting my website, I hope you come back!</p>
